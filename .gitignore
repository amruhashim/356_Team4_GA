# Ignore JSON and binary save files in the persistent data path
# Note: Files in Application.persistentDataPath are usually stored outside of the project directory,
# so they typically don't need to be ignored unless you're explicitly saving them within the repo.

# However, if they are being stored inside the repo for some reason, you could use:
SaveGame.json
Settings.json
Sensitivity.json
save_game.bin
settings.bin
sensitivity.bin
